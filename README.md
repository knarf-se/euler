My Project Euler solutions
==========================
It probably does you more harm to look than not! ;-)

So here goes; I've not really been programming anything ‘real’ since 2009, so I am imagining that this is a good way to get back into a great mental shape. 

I warn you that this is not made with the intention to be “best practises”, or even a place where you can learn anything valuable. I make this only for my self and it is really not meant that you should use this code at all!

If you get stuck at Project Euler, do not just copy my code! The only person you fool, is yourself! And you don't want to be a fool, right? ;)

DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS, AND IT IS NOT “OPEN SOURCE” PER SEE; IT IS JUST “VIEWABLE SOURCE”. DO NOT USE!!!
